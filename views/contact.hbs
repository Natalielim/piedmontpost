    <h4>Gray Cathrall, Publisher & Editor</h4>
      <p>
        Founded in October 1998, the genesis of the Piedmont Post was a love of journalism by its founder Gray Cathrall. Moving away from a career as an insurance broker in San Francisco and Oakland, he created the sports section for The Piedmonter in the late 1980s and early 1990s. With two children participating in school sports in Piedmont, he noticed the absence of local school and sports coverage, and began reporting on various school sports. He was also Sports Editor of the San Leandro Times until founding the Piedmont Post.<br>
        As an active parent, he was the first male member of what for many years was known as the Piedmont High School Mothers Club, now known as the Piedmont Parents Club.
        He was an early leader of the Piedmont Soccer Club, wrote its bylaws and helped expand it to all grade levels from Under-8 through Under 19. It became accessible for all Piedmont youth, with a combination of competitive and recreational level teams.
        He became president of the Piedmont Boosters Club and helped write its bylaws.
        By living in the community and observing issues of importance to residents, it was clear that the mission of the Post would be simple: provide weekly content with articles and photos that would inform and entertain Piedmont residents. The paper remains committed to that vision some 21 years later.
